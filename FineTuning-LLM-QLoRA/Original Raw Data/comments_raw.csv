2,"I have failed too back in 2015, specifically in Calculus, and it caused me to even change Major. I returned 7 years later with Calculus again back in college and back in my previous Major, not understanding a single bit. I can tell you that on the first lecture, if you said something in Chinese to me, I'd manage to pick something up, but from what the professor said, I wouldn't. I strongly believed that there is not a single chance I'd pass that course. Long story short, after hard work and dedication and believing in myself, I ended with an A+. Mathematics are for everyone, all you need to do is sit down and solve some exercises yourself, make some mistakes, re-think it, see the solution if you can't manage it, cover it and re-try yourself again.

It’s my second ML tutorial; much deeper and longer than the first. Obviously the instructor is the real deal: an experienced professional data scientist (see LinkedIn and GitHub accounts). Consequently, the course is very broad and detailed at the same time; not the usually 25-minute fluff-piece “Here’s Machine Learning!”
 
 My comments:
 - first half of course is theory; I started with the case study and looked at the earlier material as needed.
 - presentation leans toward the data science side of AI rather than the machine learning side.
 - causal and interpretive analysis is emphasized over predictive analysis.
 - python level is low to moderate.
 - no response to comments for two months.
 - the YouTube transcription bot and I had about equal trouble with the accent; only occasional repeats needed.
